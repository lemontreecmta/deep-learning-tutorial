This is my implementation of vectorization from Deep Learning tutorial. I rewrote code in sparseAutoEncoder.m. The dataset and the rest of the code are provided by Deep Learning Tutorial website at http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial. 

Summary (from the Deep Learning Tutorial website) This tries to optimize the code by using vectorization, which makes uses of fast linear algebra computations in MATLAB library.
